dhrystone 2.2 without warnings

The dhrystone v2.2 downloaded from [https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/dhrystone/](https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/dhrystone/) gives warnings at compile time.
Since this is annoying, I modified the notation and so on so as not to change the meaning of the program so that warnings did not appear.
